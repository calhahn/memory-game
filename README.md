## About

This is the code for a simple 16 cards single player Memory game. It is written
in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and was only tested to work in Google Chrome.

## Rules

The player turns two cards in turn to find matching pairs. If the cards match,
they remain open, otherwise they are hidden again. The game is over when all
cards have successfully been matched. The score is a combination of time and
number of moves.

## Playing

Open `index.html` in your browser to play the game. Keep in mind that it was
only tested to work in Google Chrome. Alternatively, you can play

* Icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
* Fira Sans and Fira Mono typefaces from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
